# Creating Word Definitions – Joanna Summary

## Introduction

Dictionaries provide a wide range of information about words, such as their spelling, pronunciation, etymology, and **meaning**. Research shows that most users consult dictionaries mainly to understand the meanings of rare or unfamiliar words. Because of this, lexicographers aim to define words in a **clear** and **concise** way.

## Defining Words: Two Main Approaches

### 1. Aristotelian Model

This model defines a word using two components:

- **Genus**: the general category the word belongs to
- **Differentia**: the specific features that distinguish it

**Example:**  
*Cup* → a drinking vessel (genus) that has a specific size and shape (differentia)

### 2. Encyclopedic Definitions

These go beyond basic meaning and offer extended descriptions. For instance, the word *window* is first defined as “an opening in a wall,” then elaborated with examples like *ticket window* or *store window*.

## Headwords and Word Forms

- Dictionaries define **base forms**:  
  e.g., *run* (not *ran* or *running*)
- Derived forms with different meanings are often included:  
  e.g., *help*, *helpful*, *unhelpful*

## Collocations and Corpora

Modern dictionaries like **Collins Cobuild** use **corpus data** to identify **collocations**—common word combinations such as *take part* or *make a decision*.

Definitions are often ordered by **frequency**:  
> *Impact* as “effect” appears before “collision” because it is more commonly used that way.

## Learner Dictionaries

Learner dictionaries limit vocabulary to enhance understanding.  
For example, **Collins Cobuild** uses only 2,500–3,000 words.

Some dictionaries also use **full sentences** in definitions:  
> *Fair* = “When it is fair, the weather is pleasant, dry and fine.”

## Word Class Conventions

| Part of Speech | Definition Style Example             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Noun           | "a drinking vessel"                  |
| Adjective      | "of small size", "able to be used"   |
| Verb           | "to speak", "to move something"      |

## Key Principles in Definitions

- Avoid **circularity** (e.g. defining *lynx* as *bobcat* and vice versa)
- Aim for **substitutability**:
  > *Dog* = *four-legged canine*  
  > “I have a new dog” → “I have a new four-legged canine”

## Componential Analysis

Words can be broken into **semantic features**:

| Word   | Features               |
|--------|------------------------|
| Man    | human, adult, male     |
| Woman  | human, adult, not male |
| Boy    | human, not adult, male |
| Girl   | human, not adult, not male |

These features are abstract (e.g., "humanness") and not the same as dictionary words.

### Directional Opposition (Kinship Terms)

To represent relationships like *mother* and *daughter*:

- *Mother*: female → parent  
- *Daughter*: female ← parent

The arrow indicates the direction of the relationship.

### Polar Oppositions (Gradable)

Some words exist on a **scale**, shown with arrows:

| Word  | Degree of Feature     |
|-------|------------------------|
| Hot   | temperature ↑↑         |
| Warm  | temperature ↑          |
| Cool  | temperature ↓          |
| Cold  | temperature ↓↓         |

## Semantic Primes

Based on the work of Wierzbicka, **semantic primes** are universal ideas present in all languages.

Some examples:

- **Descriptors**: BIG, SMALL  
- **Actions**: DO, HAPPEN, MOVE  
- **Time/Space**: NOW, BEFORE, AFTER, HERE, NEAR

These are **not** words, but abstract concepts.

## Semantic Relations

### Synonymy

Words with similar meanings.  
Example: *help* and *assist*

But absolute synonymy is rare. For instance:
- *stupid* vs *unintelligent*: different tone
- *buy* vs *purchase*: different context/formality

### Antonymy

Words with opposite meanings.  
Can be:

- **Gradable**: old/new, happy/sad, hot/cold
- **Binary**: dead/alive

Some are formed with prefixes:  
*legal/illegal*, *comfortable/uncomfortable*

### Hyponymy

A word whose meaning is included in a more general word.  
Example:

- *Poodle* is a **hyponym** of *dog*
- *Dog* is a **hypernym** of *poodle*

## Conclusion

Creating definitions is a complex task. Lexicographers must choose the best strategies depending on the word, the dictionary’s purpose, and the users’ needs. Whether using corpus data, semantic features, or traditional definitions, the goal remains the same: to provide accurate, understandable, and meaningful explanations of words.
