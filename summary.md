# **Summary of the Introduction Chapter**
=======
The author begins by explaining that **words**, like *sentences* and *clauses*, have an **internal structure** that follows **predictable rules**.

- For example:  
  <span style="color:teal">Plural endings</span> in English usually appear **at the end of nouns** (e.g., **_laws_**). cd 
  <span style="color:purple">Derivational affixes</span> (prefixes/suffixes that change meaning) can appear at either the **beginning** or **end** (e.g., **_unlawful_**).

---

## **Structure Isn’t Everything**

However, **structure alone** doesn’t fully explain **how words function** in real language.  
The author references **Sinclair’s (1991) Idiom Principle**, which suggests:

*Language users often rely on familiar word combinations that act as single units of meaning.*

- Example: The phrase **_set about_** usually appears:
  - With a verb ending in **-ing**
  - In patterns that **express action**

---

## **Sinclair and the Cobuild Project**

Sinclair’s research into **collocations** was part of the **Cobuild Project**, a collaboration between:
- **Birmingham University**
- **Collins Publishers**

Though **dictionaries** are not theoretical, **lexicographers** have found **practical methods** for analyzing and presenting **word meanings**.

This belongs to the field of **lexical semantics**, which explores:
- How **meanings are structured**
- How they are **related**

---

## **Types of Meaning Relationships**

Words can be grouped by **semantic relationships**:

- **Synonyms** – share similar meanings (e.g., *big* / *large*)  
- **Antonyms** – have opposite meanings (e.g., *hot* / *cold*)  
- **Co-hyponyms** – share a broader category  
  - Example: <span style="color:darkblue">**Beagle**</span> and <span style="color:darkblue">**Poodle**</span> are types of **dogs**

### *Componential Analysis*

- Tries to break words into **semantic features** (small units of meaning)
- Useful, but has **limitations**

---

## **Word Formation Processes**

The chapter also introduces how **new words** are created:
- Through **derivation**, **compounding**, and other **morphological processes**

---

## **Deixis: Words That Point**

Words don’t just carry meaning—they also **point to things** in the real world. This function is called **_deixis_**, and includes:

- **Referential deixis** – e.g., *the woman*  
- **Spatial deixis** – e.g., *this*, *that*  
- **Temporal deixis** – e.g., *yesterday*, *tomorrow*

---

## **Final Note: What Is Meaning?**

The chapter concludes by raising the question:

<span style="color:darkred">**What is "meaning"?**</span>

This question sets the stage for deeper exploration in:
- **Linguistics**
- **Philosophy of language**

# **Summary of "Varying Definitions of Meaning"**

This section explores **different approaches** to understanding the concept of **meaning in language**. As introduced in Chapter 3, two main types of meaning are distinguished:

- **Grammatical Meaning**  
  - Comes from **language structure**—its words, phrases, and grammar.  
  - Example: In *The woman called her husband*,  
    - **_woman_** = adult female  
    - **_called_** = past tense (action already happened)  
  - Can be fully interpreted using **linguistic form alone**

- **Pragmatic Meaning**  
  - Depends on **social context** and the **speaker’s intent**  
  - Example: *We’re going to be late* (spoken by a father)  
    - Implies a **hidden message** like “hurry up”  
  - Goes beyond literal interpretation

---

## **Denotation vs. Connotation**

- **Denotation** = literal, dictionary meaning  
  - Example: *Politician* = elected official  
- **Connotation** = emotional/cultural associations  
  - Example: *Politician* may suggest **dishonesty** or **manipulation**

---

## **Lyons' (1977) Three-Part Classification**

- **Descriptive Meaning** – aligns with grammatical meaning; factual  
- **Social Meaning** – helps maintain social relationships  
- **Expressive Meaning** – reflects speaker’s personal feelings or attitudes

---

## **Conclusion**

- Focus will be on **descriptive meaning** (central to philosophical semantics)  
- But **pragmatic meaning** remains important and deserves separate treatment

---

# **Summary of “The Morpheme”**

The author introduces the **morpheme** as the **smallest unit of meaning** in language.  
All words consist of one or more morphemes.

- Example: **dogs** =  
  - **dog** (animal) + **-s** (plural marker)

---

## **Types of Morphemes**

- **Free Morphemes** – can stand alone  
  - Example: *walk*  
- **Bound Morphemes** – must attach to another morpheme  
  - Example: *-ing* in *walking*

Words can combine **free** and **bound morphemes** in many ways.

---

## **The Base of a Word**

- **Base** = the form to which **affixes** attach  
- Usually a **free morpheme**, but sometimes it's bound  
  - Especially in **borrowed words** from Latin/French

- Example:  
  - *perceive*, *conceive*  
    - Root: **-ceive** (from Latin *capere*, "to take")  
    - Not an independent word in modern English

Such words are typically treated as **single morphemes** in contemporary English.

---

## **Theoretical Issues with Some Words**

- Words like **the** or **more** don’t often occur independently  
- Debate exists: Are they truly free morphemes?

General consensus:  
In the absence of a middle category, these are best regarded as **free morphemes**

# Lexical Semantics: How Words Carry Meaning

The section on **lexical semantics** focuses on how individual words express meaning and how that meaning is determined in practice. Even words that seem easy to define, like *chair*, turn out to be more complex than expected. Definitions from different dictionaries all agree that a chair is a seat for one person and has a back, but they differ on whether it needs to have four legs, arms, or how important comfort is. This highlights how meaning isn't fixed—it depends on interpretation, context, and even on the goals of those writing the definitions.

Instead of relying only on dictionary entries, linguists study word meaning using real examples from language in use. One important method in lexicography is collecting **citation slips**—short excerpts that show how a word is actually used in a sentence. The original *Oxford English Dictionary* was built using this approach, with thousands of handwritten slips submitted by volunteers. Although it was a major innovation, this process mostly captured written English from educated sources, which influenced how meaning was represented.

Another key concept is **word frequency**. According to Zipf’s Law, a small number of words (like *the*, *of*, *and*) appear extremely often, while most others occur rarely. This creates a challenge for dictionary-makers because the words that carry the most meaning—like *lexicography* or *semantics*—are often the least frequent. To illustrate this, the textbook includes a short sample paragraph where just eight words account for more than a third of the total word count:

| Word     | Number of occurrences |
|----------|------------------------|
| the      | 10                     |
| a        | 7                      |
| of       | 6                      |
| word(s)  | 6                      |
| as       | 5                      |
| from     | 3                      |
| on       | 3                      |
| which    | 3                      |
|Total       | 43                   |

To capture low-frequency but semantically rich words, lexicographers now use large text collections, or **corpora**, that include both written and spoken language.

With tools like **concordancers**, it’s easier to explore how words behave in different contexts. For example, *chair* can refer to furniture or to a role like *chair of a department*. This is an example of **polysemy**, where a single word has multiple related meanings. Deciding whether those are separate senses or just contextual variations is part of the lexicographer’s job.

A well-known experiment by Labov shows how meaning can shift depending on context. Participants were shown images of containers and asked to label them. When presented neutrally, many called one object a *cup*, but when told it held mashed potatoes, they were more likely to call it a *bowl*. This kind of context sensitivity explains why dictionary definitions often include words like *usually* or *commonly*, allowing for flexibility rather than rigid categories.

In the end, lexical semantics reveals that word meaning is shaped not just by form, but by use, frequency, and the situation in which language occurs.

# Creating Word Definitions – Summary

## Introduction

Dictionaries provide a wide range of information about words, such as their spelling, pronunciation, etymology, and **meaning**. Research shows that most users consult dictionaries mainly to understand the meanings of rare or unfamiliar words. Because of this, lexicographers aim to define words in a **clear** and **concise** way.

## Defining Words: Two Main Approaches

### 1. Aristotelian Model

This model defines a word using two components:

- **Genus**: the general category the word belongs to
- **Differentia**: the specific features that distinguish it

**Example:**  
*Cup* → a drinking vessel (genus) that has a specific size and shape (differentia)

### 2. Encyclopedic Definitions

These go beyond basic meaning and offer extended descriptions. For instance, the word *window* is first defined as “an opening in a wall,” then elaborated with examples like *ticket window* or *store window*.

## Headwords and Word Forms

- Dictionaries define **base forms**:  
  e.g., *run* (not *ran* or *running*)
- Derived forms with different meanings are often included:  
  e.g., *help*, *helpful*, *unhelpful*

## Collocations and Corpora

Modern dictionaries like **Collins Cobuild** use **corpus data** to identify **collocations**—common word combinations such as *take part* or *make a decision*.

Definitions are often ordered by **frequency**:  
> *Impact* as “effect” appears before “collision” because it is more commonly used that way.

## Learner Dictionaries

Learner dictionaries limit vocabulary to enhance understanding.  
For example, **Collins Cobuild** uses only 2,500–3,000 words.

Some dictionaries also use **full sentences** in definitions:  
> *Fair* = “When it is fair, the weather is pleasant, dry and fine.”

## Word Class Conventions

| Part of Speech | Definition Style Example             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Noun           | "a drinking vessel"                  |
| Adjective      | "of small size", "able to be used"   |
| Verb           | "to speak", "to move something"      |

## Key Principles in Definitions

- Avoid **circularity** (e.g. defining *lynx* as *bobcat* and vice versa)
- Aim for **substitutability**:
  > *Dog* = *four-legged canine*  
  > “I have a new dog” → “I have a new four-legged canine”

## Componential Analysis

Words can be broken into **semantic features**:

| Word   | Features               |
|--------|------------------------|
| Man    | human, adult, male     |
| Woman  | human, adult, not male |
| Boy    | human, not adult, male |
| Girl   | human, not adult, not male |

These features are abstract (e.g., "humanness") and not the same as dictionary words.

### Directional Opposition (Kinship Terms)

To represent relationships like *mother* and *daughter*:

- *Mother*: female → parent  
- *Daughter*: female ← parent

The arrow indicates the direction of the relationship.

### Polar Oppositions (Gradable)

Some words exist on a **scale**, shown with arrows:

| Word  | Degree of Feature     |
|-------|------------------------|
| Hot   | temperature ↑↑         |
| Warm  | temperature ↑          |
| Cool  | temperature ↓          |
| Cold  | temperature ↓↓         |

## Semantic Primes

Based on the work of Wierzbicka, **semantic primes** are universal ideas present in all languages.

Some examples:

- **Descriptors**: BIG, SMALL  
- **Actions**: DO, HAPPEN, MOVE  
- **Time/Space**: NOW, BEFORE, AFTER, HERE, NEAR

These are **not** words, but abstract concepts.

## Semantic Relations

### Synonymy

Words with similar meanings.  
Example: *help* and *assist*

But absolute synonymy is rare. For instance:
- *stupid* vs *unintelligent*: different tone
- *buy* vs *purchase*: different context/formality

### Antonymy

Words with opposite meanings.  
Can be:

- **Gradable**: old/new, happy/sad, hot/cold
- **Binary**: dead/alive

Some are formed with prefixes:  
*legal/illegal*, *comfortable/uncomfortable*

### Hyponymy

A word whose meaning is included in a more general word.  
Example:


- *Poodle* is a **hyponym** of *dog*
- *Dog* is a **hypernym** of *poodle*

---

## Conclusion

Creating definitions is a complex task. Lexicographers must choose the best strategies depending on the word, the dictionary’s purpose, and the users’ needs. Whether using corpus data, semantic features, or traditional definitions, the goal remains the same: to provide accurate, understandable, and meaningful explanations of words.


# Creating New Vocabulary in English

## 

New words emerge when new ideas or phenomena need naming. While linguists can identify general processes for forming new words, it's hard to say exactly when a word was first used or why it becomes widely accepted. Dictionaries like the Oxford English Dictionary offer historical citations but don’t explain why some words catch on universally.

## Meaning Extension

A common way to create new words is **meaning extension**, where an existing word gains a new sense.

- **Example:** *Memory* originally meant human memory but extended to computers by the 1940s.
- **Example:** *9/11* refers not only to the date of the 2001 attacks but also symbolizes the event and global terrorism. It’s memorable because it matches the US emergency number 911 and visually represents the twin towers.

This process often creates metaphors, like:

- *The head of the organization* (leader)
- *The heart of the problem* (central issue)
- *At arm’s length* (keeping distance)

Another example is *family*, which can mean:

- People related by blood or marriage  
- A crime group, e.g., the “Gambino family”

## Common Word Formation Processes

### Compounding

**Compounding** combines two words to create a new one with a specific meaning.

- **Examples:**  
  - *Policeman* (police + man)  
  - *Birthmark* (birth + mark)  
  - *Blackberry* (black + berry)  
  - *Playoff* (play + off)

Compounds can be written as one word, hyphenated, or separate words depending on tradition and meaning.

Stress patterns also differ:

- *white house* (a house painted white)  
- *White House* (the U.S. president’s residence)

### Affixation

Adding prefixes or suffixes creates new words.

- **Examples:**  
  - *Texter* (someone who sends texts)  
  - *Subprime* (a risky loan)  
  - *Flexitarian* (mostly vegetarian but sometimes eats meat)

### Borrowing

English borrows words from many languages:

- From Old Norse: *sky*, *skin*  
- From German: *kindergarten*, *hamburger*  
- From Arabic: *coffee*, *alcohol*  
- From Yiddish: *bagel*, *schmooze*  
- From Chinese: *kung fu*, *chow mein*  
- From Spanish: *taco*, *avocado*

### Functional Shift

Sometimes a word changes its grammatical category without changing form.

- **Example:**  
  - *Bottle* can be a noun or a verb ("She bottles her own beer.")  
  - *Google* went from a company name to a verb ("I googled the recipe.")

### Root Creation

Some words are invented from scratch.

- **Example:** *Googol* (a huge number) led to *Google*.  
- Echoic words imitate sounds, like *buzz* or *splash*.

### Clipping and Blending

- **Clipping:** Shortening a longer word.  
  - *Flu* (influenza)  
  - *Phone* (telephone)  
  - *Doc* (doctor)

- **Blending:** Combining parts of two words.  
  - *Brunch* (breakfast + lunch)  
  - *Smog* (smoke + fog)  
  - *Blog* (web + log)

### Acronyms and Abbreviations

- **Acronyms** are pronounced as words:  
  - *NATO* (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)  
  - *Laser* (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation)

- **Abbreviations** are spelled out letter by letter:  
  - *FBI* (Federal Bureau of Investigation)  
  - *CIA* (Central Intelligence Agency)

### Back-Formation

New words sometimes form by removing parts from existing words.

- **Examples:**  
  - *Edit* from *editor*  
  - *Liaise* from *liaison*  
  - *Burgle* from *burglar*

### Folk Etymology

Borrowed words can be changed to sound more English.

- **Examples:**  
  - *Pea* (from Old English *pease*, mistakenly taken as plural)  
  - *Chaise lounge* (from French *chaise longue*)  
  - *Humble pie* (originally *umble pie*, made from animal intestines)

## 

English vocabulary is dynamic, shaped by many processes. Some new words become permanent, while others fade away. Understanding how words form helps us appreciate the richness and flexibility of the language.

# Deixis

Deixis refers to the "pointing" function of language - how words can refer to people, objects, times, or places in relation to the context of an utterance. Words do not just have static meanings; they can also function dynamically by indicating or "pointing at" entities, locations, or times, depending on who is speaking, when, and where.

---

## Illustrative Example

The text opens with an example from a radio show, where both hosts (who are brothers) say, "Don't drive like my brother." Although the phrase is identical, "my brother" refers to a different person in each utterance. This highlights how deixis operates: the referent of "my brother" changes based on who is speaking. This is an example of **referential deixis**—the use of language to refer to entities in the world, with the reference determined by the context of utterance.

---

## Types of Deixis

### 1. Referential Deixis

Referential deixis is divided into two main types:

- **Exophora:** Reference to something outside the text, relying on the situational context.  
  *Example:* Pronouns like "I," "we," "you," and demonstratives like "that" in a conversation are exophoric—they refer to the speaker, the addressee, or objects in the shared environment. Understanding these references requires knowledge of the context in which the utterance occurs.

- **Endophora:** Reference within the text itself, creating connections or "cohesive ties" between parts of the text. Endophora is further divided into:
  - **Anaphoric Reference:** Refers back to something previously mentioned (the antecedent).  
    *Example:* After introducing "Sophie Green," subsequent references to "she" or "her" are anaphoric.
  - **Cataphoric Reference:** Refers forward to something that will be mentioned later.  
    *Example:* "Although she was tired, the woman continued working"—"she" anticipates the noun "the woman".

Endophoric reference is more common in written texts, where the reader must rely on textual cues rather than shared physical context.

---

### 2. Broad Reference

Sometimes, pronouns like "that" or "this" do not refer to a single noun phrase, but to a larger idea or stretch of discourse.  
*Example:* "That" can refer to an entire concept or previous statement, and "this" can refer to a whole preceding conversation turn. Such broad reference is especially common in informal speech.

---

### 3. Generic vs. Specific Reference

- **Generic Reference:** Refers to all members of a class, not specific individuals.  
  *Example:* "students" in "Even when students arrive at university..." refers to students in general.

- **Specific Reference:** Refers to particular entities.  
  *Example:* "students" in a news report about a specific incident refers to actual people involved.

Specific reference can be further divided into:
  - **Indefinite Reference:** Refers to a non-specific entity (e.g., "a student").
  - **Definite Reference:** Refers to a known, specific entity (e.g., "the students").

---

## Context Dependence

- **Spoken Language:** Exophoric reference is prevalent, as the physical and social context is shared between speaker and listener.
- **Written Language:** Endophoric reference dominates, as the context must be established within the text itself. First and second person pronouns ("I," "you") can occur in writing but are more typical of informal writing.

## Summary Table

| Type         | Subtype     | Example                                         | Context Required         |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Referential  | Exophora    | "I," "you," "that" (in conversation)           | External (situational)  |
| Referential  | Endophora   | "she" referring back to "Sophie Green"          | Internal (textual)      |
| Endophora    | Anaphoric   | "she" after "Sophie Green"                      | Previous text           |
| Endophora    | Cataphoric  | "Although she was tired, the woman..."          | Following text          |
| Broad Ref.   | —           | "that" referring to a whole idea                | Discourse context       |
| Reference    | Generic     | "students" (all students)                       | General knowledge       |
| Reference    | Specific    | "the students" (particular group)               | Shared or textual       |


## Spatial Deixis

Spatial Deixis refers to the way language situates people, objects, and actions in space relative to the speaker or writer. It examines how demonstratives (this, that, these, those), spatial adverbs (here, there), and certain prepositions (in, on) function to indicate proximity or distance, both physically and metaphorically.

### Demonstratives and Spatial Reference

**Proximal vs. Distal:**  
Demonstratives and spatial adverbs have proximal (near the speaker) and distal (far from the speaker) uses.

- **Proximal examples:**
  - "this computer" (the computer is near the speaker)
  - "these chairs and tables here" (items close to the speaker)

- **Distal examples:**
  - "that guy" (the person is farther from the speaker)
  - "those few begonias" (plants farther away from the speaker than "these" plants)

**Dialogic Use:**  
In conversation, speakers may use different demonstratives to refer to the same type of object, depending on their relative spatial positions. For example, one speaker refers to "these damn plants" (close to her), while the other refers to "those few begonias" (farther away).

### Beyond Physical Distance

**Abstract and Discourse Reference:**  
Demonstratives do not always refer to physical objects or locations. They can also refer to:
- Properties of objects
- Actions or events
- Abstract features of the situation
- Previous statements or ideas in the discourse

For example, in "Right, forget that. Scrap that point," "that" refers to a previous statement, not a physical entity. In such cases, the choice between "this" and "that" may not signal spatial proximity but rather serves a textual or discourse function.

### Spatial Adverbials and Prepositions

**Adverbs:**  
"Here" and "there" specify locations relative to the speaker:

> "Is it here, or is it there? I think it's upstairs."  
> The speaker contrasts locations near and far and introduces another possible location ("upstairs").

**Prepositions:**  
Phrases like "in the room," "on the roof," or "a few doors away" use prepositions to further situate entities in space relative to the speaker or other reference points.

## Temporal Deixis

Temporal deixis explores how language anchors events, actions, and states in time relative to the moment of speaking or writing. English uses various linguistic mechanisms to express time, including prepositions, adverbials, and verb tenses.

### Temporal Prepositions and Their Evolution

Many English prepositions that now indicate time (e.g., *in the morning*, *on time*, *at noon*, *by the evening*) originally had spatial meanings. This shift reflects a broader linguistic trend where spatial terms evolve to express temporal relationships.

### Linguistic Markers of Temporal Deixis

- **Temporal Adverbials:** Words and phrases such as *yesterday*, *tomorrow*, *in the morning* directly specify points or periods in time.
- **Verb Tense:** English verbs are marked for present and past tense, which situate events relative to the time of utterance. Unlike some languages, English lacks a true morphological future tense. Instead, it uses modal verbs (*will*, *shall*), periphrastic constructions (*be going to*), or present tense with a future-time adverbial (*I return to town next week*) to indicate future events.

### Reference Point for Temporal Deixis

The present—the moment of speaking or writing—is the principal reference point for temporal deixis. Events are described as occurring before (past), at (present), or after (future) this point.

### Tense and Aspect in English

- **Present and Past Tense:** Marked morphologically on verbs. The present tense can indicate the instantaneous present (*There goes that bloody dog*), a timeless state (*She speaks English*), or habitual actions (*She gets up at nine every day*).
- **No Morphological Future Tense:** Future meaning is constructed using modal verbs or adverbials.
- **Aspect:** While not strictly deictic, aspect interacts with tense to express temporal relationships:
  - **Perfective Aspect** (e.g., *have made*, *has produced*): Indicates an event that began in the past and continues to the present or has relevance to the present.
  - **Past Perfect** (e.g., *had been arrested*): Describes an event completed before another past event.
  - **Progressive Aspect** (e.g., *is working*, *was reading*): Describes ongoing actions, either in the present or past.
  - **Perfective + Progressive** (e.g., *have been listening*): Combines ongoing activity with a time frame stretching from the past to the present.

### Temporal Deixis in Discourse

The choice of tense and aspect allows speakers to sequence events and indicate their relevance or completion relative to the present moment.

Adverbials often clarify or even override the temporal meaning of verb forms (e.g., *just* in *everybody has just left the room* can make the difference between present perfect and simple past negligible).

## Conclusion
Deixis is the linguistic mechanism by which language "points" to entities in the world or in discourse. Understanding deixis requires attention to context: who is speaking, when, where, and what has already been said. English uses both exophoric (context-dependent) and endophoric (text-dependent) reference, with different prevalence in spoken and written language. Pronouns and demonstratives can refer narrowly (to a noun phrase) or broadly (to whole ideas or stretches of conversation). Reference can be generic (all members of a class) or specific (particular entities), and can be definite or indefinite depending on the context and shared knowledge.

Spatial deixis is not limited to literal, physical space but extends to the organization of discourse and abstract reference. The choice of demonstrative (this/these vs. that/those) is context-dependent and can be influenced by physical distance, discourse structure, or speaker intention. Spatial adverbials and prepositional phrases enrich the spatial landscape of utterances, allowing speakers to specify, contrast, or elaborate on locations in nuanced ways. 

Temporal deixis, like spatial deixis, is fundamentally anchored in the speaker's "here and now." English uses a combination of prepositions, adverbials, tense, and aspect to express when events occur relative to the present. The distinction between tense and aspect can be subtle, and their interaction allows for nuanced temporal reference. The evolution of spatial terms into temporal markers illustrates the close conceptual link between space and time in language.
