### Lexical Semantics: How Words Carry Meaning

The section on **lexical semantics** focuses on how individual words express meaning and how that meaning is determined in practice. Even words that seem easy to define, like *chair*, turn out to be more complex than expected. Definitions from different dictionaries all agree that a chair is a seat for one person and has a back, but they differ on whether it needs to have four legs, arms, or how important comfort is. This highlights how meaning isn't fixed—it depends on interpretation, context, and even on the goals of those writing the definitions.

Instead of relying only on dictionary entries, linguists study word meaning using real examples from language in use. One important method in lexicography is collecting **citation slips**—short excerpts that show how a word is actually used in a sentence. The original *Oxford English Dictionary* was built using this approach, with thousands of handwritten slips submitted by volunteers. Although it was a major innovation, this process mostly captured written English from educated sources, which influenced how meaning was represented.

Another key concept is **word frequency**. According to Zipf’s Law, a small number of words (like *the*, *of*, *and*) appear extremely often, while most others occur rarely. This creates a challenge for dictionary-makers because the words that carry the most meaning—like *lexicography* or *semantics*—are often the least frequent. To illustrate this, the textbook includes a short sample paragraph where just eight words account for more than a third of the total word count:

| Word     | Number of occurrences |
|----------|------------------------|
| the      | 10                     |
| a        | 7                      |
| of       | 6                      |
| word(s)  | 6                      |
| as       | 5                      |
| from     | 3                      |
| on       | 3                      |
| which    | 3                      |
|Total       | 43                   |

To capture low-frequency but semantically rich words, lexicographers now use large text collections, or **corpora**, that include both written and spoken language.

With tools like **concordancers**, it’s easier to explore how words behave in different contexts. For example, *chair* can refer to furniture or to a role like *chair of a department*. This is an example of **polysemy**, where a single word has multiple related meanings. Deciding whether those are separate senses or just contextual variations is part of the lexicographer’s job.

A well-known experiment by Labov shows how meaning can shift depending on context. Participants were shown images of containers and asked to label them. When presented neutrally, many called one object a *cup*, but when told it held mashed potatoes, they were more likely to call it a *bowl*. This kind of context sensitivity explains why dictionary definitions often include words like *usually* or *commonly*, allowing for flexibility rather than rigid categories.

In the end, lexical semantics reveals that word meaning is shaped not just by form, but by use, frequency, and the situation in which language occurs.



# Creating Word Definitions – Summary

## Introduction

Dictionaries provide a wide range of information about words, such as their spelling, pronunciation, etymology, and **meaning**. Research shows that most users consult dictionaries mainly to understand the meanings of rare or unfamiliar words. Because of this, lexicographers aim to define words in a **clear** and **concise** way.

## Defining Words: Two Main Approaches

### 1. Aristotelian Model

This model defines a word using two components:

- **Genus**: the general category the word belongs to
- **Differentia**: the specific features that distinguish it

**Example:**  
*Cup* → a drinking vessel (genus) that has a specific size and shape (differentia)

### 2. Encyclopedic Definitions

These go beyond basic meaning and offer extended descriptions. For instance, the word *window* is first defined as “an opening in a wall,” then elaborated with examples like *ticket window* or *store window*.

## Headwords and Word Forms

- Dictionaries define **base forms**:  
  e.g., *run* (not *ran* or *running*)
- Derived forms with different meanings are often included:  
  e.g., *help*, *helpful*, *unhelpful*

## Collocations and Corpora

Modern dictionaries like **Collins Cobuild** use **corpus data** to identify **collocations**—common word combinations such as *take part* or *make a decision*.

Definitions are often ordered by **frequency**:  
> *Impact* as “effect” appears before “collision” because it is more commonly used that way.

## Learner Dictionaries

Learner dictionaries limit vocabulary to enhance understanding.  
For example, **Collins Cobuild** uses only 2,500–3,000 words.

Some dictionaries also use **full sentences** in definitions:  
> *Fair* = “When it is fair, the weather is pleasant, dry and fine.”

## Word Class Conventions

| Part of Speech | Definition Style Example             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Noun           | "a drinking vessel"                  |
| Adjective      | "of small size", "able to be used"   |
| Verb           | "to speak", "to move something"      |

## Key Principles in Definitions

- Avoid **circularity** (e.g. defining *lynx* as *bobcat* and vice versa)
- Aim for **substitutability**:
  > *Dog* = *four-legged canine*  
  > “I have a new dog” → “I have a new four-legged canine”

## Componential Analysis

Words can be broken into **semantic features**:

| Word   | Features               |
|--------|------------------------|
| Man    | human, adult, male     |
| Woman  | human, adult, not male |
| Boy    | human, not adult, male |
| Girl   | human, not adult, not male |

These features are abstract (e.g., "humanness") and not the same as dictionary words.

### Directional Opposition (Kinship Terms)

To represent relationships like *mother* and *daughter*:

- *Mother*: female → parent  
- *Daughter*: female ← parent

The arrow indicates the direction of the relationship.

### Polar Oppositions (Gradable)

Some words exist on a **scale**, shown with arrows:

| Word  | Degree of Feature     |
|-------|------------------------|
| Hot   | temperature ↑↑         |
| Warm  | temperature ↑          |
| Cool  | temperature ↓          |
| Cold  | temperature ↓↓         |

## Semantic Primes

Based on the work of Wierzbicka, **semantic primes** are universal ideas present in all languages.

Some examples:

- **Descriptors**: BIG, SMALL  
- **Actions**: DO, HAPPEN, MOVE  
- **Time/Space**: NOW, BEFORE, AFTER, HERE, NEAR

These are **not** words, but abstract concepts.

## Semantic Relations

### Synonymy

Words with similar meanings.  
Example: *help* and *assist*

But absolute synonymy is rare. For instance:
- *stupid* vs *unintelligent*: different tone
- *buy* vs *purchase*: different context/formality

### Antonymy

Words with opposite meanings.  
Can be:

- **Gradable**: old/new, happy/sad, hot/cold
- **Binary**: dead/alive

Some are formed with prefixes:  
*legal/illegal*, *comfortable/uncomfortable*

### Hyponymy

A word whose meaning is included in a more general word.  
Example:


- *Poodle* is a **hyponym** of *dog*
- *Dog* is a **hypernym** of *poodle*

## Conclusion

Creating definitions is a complex task. Lexicographers must choose the best strategies depending on the word, the dictionary’s purpose, and the users’ needs. Whether using corpus data, semantic features, or traditional definitions, the goal remains the same: to provide accurate, understandable, and meaningful explanations of words.
